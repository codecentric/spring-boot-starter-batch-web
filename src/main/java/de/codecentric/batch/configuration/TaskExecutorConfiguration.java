/**
 * This is the default configuration for a {@link org.springframework.core.task.TaskExecutor} used in the {@link org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.SimpleJobLauncher}
 * for starting jobs asynchronously. Its core thread pool is configured to five threads by default, which can be changed
 * by setting the property batch.core.pool.size to a different number. 
 * 
 * Please note the following rules of the ThreadPoolExecutor:
 * If the number of threads is less than the corePoolSize, the executor creates a new thread to run a new task.
 * If the number of threads is equal (or greater than) the corePoolSize, the executor puts the task into the queue.
 * If the queue is full and the number of threads is less than the maxPoolSize, the executor creates a new thread to run a new task.
 * If the queue is full and the number of threads is greater than or equal to maxPoolSize, reject the task.
 * 
 * So with the default configuration there will be only 5 jobs/threads at the same time.
 * 
 * The {@link org.springframework.core.task.TaskExecutor} may also be used in job configurations
 * for multi-threaded job execution. In XML you can use it by name, which is taskExecutor. In JavaConfig,
 * you can either autowire {@link org.springframework.core.task.TaskExecutor} or, if you want to know
 * where it's configured, this class.
