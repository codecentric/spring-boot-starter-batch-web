/**
 * This listener writes the job log file name to the MDC so that it can be picked up by the logging
 * framework for logging to it. It's a {@link JobExecutionListener} and a {@link StepExecutionListener}
 * because in partitioning we may have a lot of {@link StepExecution}s running in different threads.
 * Due to the fact that the afterStep - method would remove the variable from the MDC in single threaded
 * execution we need to re-set it, that's what's the {@link LoggingAfterJobListener} is for.
 * Note that, of the three local parallelization features in Spring Batch, log file separation only 
 * works for partitioning and parallel step, not for multi-threaded step.
 * 
 * The log file name is determined by a {@link JobLogFileNameCreator}. It's default implementation
 * {@link DefaultJobLogFileNameCreator} is used when there's no other bean of this type in the 
 * ApplicationContext.
